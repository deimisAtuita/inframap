One of the main contributions of Ekman's book is the development of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which is a method of measuring facial movement based on the anatomy of the facial muscles. FACS allows researchers and practitioners to identify and classify the subtle and complex expressions that humans produce in various emotional states. FACS can also be used to analyze the asymmetries and inconsistencies that may indicate deception or hidden emotions.
 
Another important contribution of Ekman's book is the demonstration of the universality of some facial expressions across different cultures and regions. Ekman conducted cross-cultural studies in which he showed photographs of facial expressions to people from various countries and asked them to label the emotions they perceived. He found that there was a high agreement on the recognition of six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. This suggests that these emotions are innate and have a biological basis, rather than being learned or influenced by culture.
 
However, Ekman also acknowledged that there are variations and nuances in facial expression that depend on the context, the individual, and the culture. He proposed the concept of display rules, which are social norms that regulate when, how, and to whom people express their emotions. Display rules can affect how people modify, amplify, or conceal their facial expressions in different situations. For example, some cultures may encourage smiling even when feeling unhappy, while others may discourage showing anger or fear.
